// I could've used separate vectors for normal layers and overlay layers but I didn't cause from what I understand, later if I want to check for a general layer variable and i don't know where it might be, I'll have to traverse both arrays separately
// That would still kinda be equal in terms of speed I imagine but would make for messy code later on
// So I'm going with the same approach as the hazel engine.
// I know everything looks identical to hazel engine so far but I promise I'm looking up why I'm writing what I'm writing and trying my best to understand why I'm writing it like this.
// Real differences will start appearing in the renderer part of the engine later so yeah
